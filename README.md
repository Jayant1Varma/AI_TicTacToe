# AI_TicTacToe

Artificially intelligent tic-tac-toe that offers two modes of gameplay. User can either play against a friend by choosing multiplayer mode or vs computer by choice. The multiplayer mode offers both users the same tools as playing on paper and checks for any attempts at cheating by trying to overrite another player's squares. It checks for win and declares the winner, or a tie.

The vs computer part offers more than just checking for wins, it plays instead of your friend. The program does exhaustive search to predict the future winning move. Based on this, the computer chooses the best option, be it defensive against the user's winning sequence or, offensive taking the win for itself. Besides this, the computer player always goes for the win by choosing to take the probability favoured squares. For example, it will always try to take a free centre square if available, then corner one's, etc. 

Have fun playing!
