# AI_TicTacToe

Artificially intelligent tic-tac-toe that does exhaustive search to predict the future winning move. Based on this, the computer player chooses the best option, be it defensive against the user's winning sequence or, offensive taking the win for itself. Besides this, the computer player always goes for the win by choosing to take the probability favoured squares. For example, it will always try to take a free centre square if available, then cornor one's, etc. 

Have fun playing!
